<h3>Late bloomer, but guess what, I love coding!</h3>
<p>No I have not been coding since I was 12 years old. I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I didn't write a single line of code until I was 30 years old. The coding community leans younger. But, I think there will always be room for people like me.</p>
<h3>I always thoughtt that you had to be brilliant to contribute in a meaningful way as a coder</h3>
<p>But, as I've spent more time in the community, I've discovered that being a good coder is more than just IQ or how long you've been doing it. I am passionate about writing good code that is easy to maintian, easy to debug, and works efficiently. I also have a very good attention span. I enjoying tinkering with problems for hours to get the code to work correctly.</p>
