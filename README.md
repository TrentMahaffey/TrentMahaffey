<h3>Late bloomer, but guess what, I love coding!</h3>
<p>No I have not been coding since I was 12 years old. I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I didn't write a single line of code until I was 30 years old. The coding community leans younger. But, I think there will always be room for people like me.</p>
<h3>I always thoughtt that you had to be brilliant to contribute in a meaningful way as a coder</h3>
<p>But, as I've spent more time in the community, I've discovered that being a good coder is more than just IQ or how long you've been doing it. I am passionate about writing good code that is easy to maintian, easy to debug, and works efficiently. I also have a very good attention span. I enjoying tinkering with problems for hours to get the code to work correctly.</p>


<h3>Coding is a lifelong journey</h3>
<p>I've come a long way, but I still have a long way to go! Regardless of where I am and where I could be for my age, I do think that for my time working in this field I've become pretty proficient. And besides all of that, if you like doing it, and you actively try to get better, all the other stuff dones't really matter anyways.</p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>

<ol>

<li><b>SCADA - </b>I've spent the last 10 years working in Industrial Automation. My knowledge in electrical systems, transmitters, controllers, and manufacturing ultimately resulted in me working as an Automation Engineer starting in 2019. Since then, I've done a LOT of SCADA, mostly on Inductive Automation's Ignition platform. In my opinion, the how the developers allowed the scripting be leveraged in nearly every facet of their framework is where this platform really shines.</li>
 
<br>


<li><b>Python - </b>I love, love love love Python. Sure, it's not the fastest language. But the portability is just amazing, and people can write good code in a reasonable amount of time. Take a look at my repository for some of my Leetcode solutions in Python!</li>
  
<br>  

<li><b>SQL - </b>Gotta know SQL in order to be worth a damn in my opinion. Data is the most valualbe commodity in the entire world, and all that data is stored in, SQL databases.</li>
