<h3>Late bloomer, but guess what, I love coding!</h3>
<p>No I have not been coding since I was 12 years old. I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I didn't write a single line of code until I was 30 years old. The coding community leans younger. But, I think there will always be room for people like me.</p>
<h3>I always thoughtt that you had to be brilliant to contribute in a meaningful way as a coder</h3>
<p>But, as I've spent more time in the community, I've discovered that being a good coder is more than just IQ or how long you've been doing it. I am passionate about writing good code that is easy to maintian, easy to debug, and works efficiently. I also have a very good attention span. I enjoying tinkering with problems for hours to get the code to work correctly.</p>


<h3>I view coding as a lifelong journey</h3>
<p>I've come a long way, but I still have a long way to go! Regardless of where I am and where I could be for my age, I do think that for my time working in this field I've become pretty proficient. And besides all of that, if you like doing it, and you actively try to get better, all the other stuff dones't really matter anyways.</p>
